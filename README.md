## Welcome to Coffee Bot

> #### Coffee Bot is an **open source** bot with some nifty features:
>
> - A *simple* yet **effective** reporting system which uses context menus to handle user and member reports (detailed examples with images on my top.gg page).
> - A Discord server invite filter, link filter and chat filter - all with an optional log channel.
> - Detailed message edit and message delete logs showing _who deleted_ a message. Also see _all messages_ deleted in a bulk delete.
