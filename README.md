## Welcome to Coffee Bot

> #### Coffee Bot is an **open source**, verified Discord bot with some handy features:
>
> - A *simple* yet **effective** reporting system which uses context menus to handle user and member reports (detailed examples with images on my top.gg page). Staff can then mark reports as either 'Actioned' or as a 'False Positive'.
> - A Discord server invite filter, link filter and chat filter - all with an optional log channel.
> - Detailed message edit and message delete logs showing _who deleted_ a message. Also see _all messages_ deleted in a bulk delete.
> - Member nickname, timeout and member role update logs showing *who* did what. Additionally, you can view *all members* that had a role when it gets deleted.
